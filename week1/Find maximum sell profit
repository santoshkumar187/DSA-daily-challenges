Problem Understanding

You are given the price of a stock on each day.
You can buy once and sell once later.
You must find the maximum profit you can make.

For example:

Prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]


Here:

You can buy at 1

Sell at 6

Profit = 6 - 1 = 5
âœ… So, maximum profit = 5



******// code exmaple //*****

public class MaxProfit {
    public static int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int minPrice = prices[0];
        int maxProfit = 0;

        // Go through each price
        for (int price : prices) {
            // If current price is smaller, update minPrice
            if (price < minPrice) {
                minPrice = price;
            }
            // Calculate profit if we sell today
            int profit = price - minPrice;

            // Update maxProfit if current profit is greater
            if (profit > maxProfit) {
                maxProfit = profit;
            }
        }

        return maxProfit;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] prices = {7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4};
        System.out.println("Maximum Profit: " + maxProfit(prices));
    }
}

// output///
ðŸ’¡ Output:
Maximum Profit: 5

ðŸ§  Explanation:

Buy when price is lowest (1)

Sell when price is highest after that (6)

Profit = 6 - 1 = 5
