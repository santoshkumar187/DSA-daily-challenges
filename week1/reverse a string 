Awesome choice 💪 — this is a classic DSA string manipulation problem often asked in interviews like at Amazon, TCS, or Infosys.

Let’s go step-by-step, from problem understanding → logic → code → explanation — in beginner-friendly style 👇

🧠 Problem: Reverse Words in a String

❓ Question:

You’re given a string s that may contain words separated by spaces.
Your task:
👉 Reverse the order of words,
👉 Remove extra spaces,
👉 Return the cleaned, reversed string.


---

🔹 Example 1

Input:  "  the sky  is blue  "
Output: "blue is sky the"

Explanation:

Original words: ["the", "sky", "is", "blue"]

Reversed: ["blue", "is", "sky", "the"]

Joined with single spaces → "blue is sky the"



---

🔹 Example 2

Input:  "hello world"
Output: "world hello"


---

🧩 Step-by-Step Beginner Explanation

Let’s break it down:

Step 1️⃣ – Split the String

The method split("\\s+") splits the string into words (using regex to handle multiple spaces).


String[] words = s.trim().split("\\s+");

👉 trim() removes spaces at start and end.
👉 split("\\s+") splits wherever there’s one or more spaces.

For "  the sky  is blue  " →
words = ["the", "sky", "is", "blue"]


---

Step 2️⃣ – Reverse the Words

We can reverse the array of words manually or use a library method.


---

Step 3️⃣ – Join Back into a Single String

Use String.join(" ", array) to combine words with a single space.


Java Code: Clean & Simple

public class ReverseWords {
    public static String reverseWords(String s) {
        // Step 1: Remove extra spaces and split
        String[] words = s.trim().split("\\s+");
        
        // Step 2: Reverse words
        StringBuilder reversed = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = words.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            reversed.append(words[i]);
            if (i != 0) reversed.append(" "); // add space between words
        }
        
        // Step 3: Return reversed string
        return reversed.toString();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "  the sky  is blue  ";
        System.out.println(reverseWords(s)); // Output: blue is sky the
    }
}

🧮 Dry Run

Input: "  the sky  is blue  "

After trim() → "the sky  is blue"

After split("\\s+") → ["the", "sky", "is", "blue"]

Reverse order → ["blue", "is", "sky", "the"]

Join → "blue is sky the"


✅ Output → "blue is sky the"

🧾 Interview Tips

Mention trim() and split("\\s+") to handle extra spaces.

Always reverse words, not characters.

StringBuilder is preferred over string concatenation for efficiency.
